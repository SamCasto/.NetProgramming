# .NetProgramming
Classwork that I have completed for my .NET/C# classes
These are projects that I have uploaded immediately after submitting them. The hope is that during spring or summer break I can
fix some of the erros/inaccuracies found in them. I will be the first to admit the GUI is not flattering.
